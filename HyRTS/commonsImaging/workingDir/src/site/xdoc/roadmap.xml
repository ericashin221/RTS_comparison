<section name="Roadmap">
<subsection name="Version 2.0">
  <p>
      Features we hope to have for the 2.0 release.
  </p>
  <h4>Interoperability</h4>
  <ul>
  	  <li>Port to use the Java 7 language but only use basic Java 5 APIs.</li>
  	  <li>Android support. Needs AWT to be an optional dependency.</li>
      <li>Add the ability to use Commons Imaging as an Image I/O plugin.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>File formats</h4>
  <ul>
  	  <li>Improve JPEG read support.</li>
  	  <li>Rewrite and fully generalize TIFF parsing to support arbitrary complexity TIFF files instead of just EXIF.
  	  		Lower level API for reading raw fields and directories, and a higher level API for image structures.</li>
  	  <li>Add pluggable TIFF tag sets.</li>
  	  <li>Parse some EXIF maker notes.</li>
      <li>Add a structured way to write IPTC image metadata to JPEG files.</li>
      <li>Reading all images from .gif files isn't working. see: getAllBufferedImages().</li>
      <li>Add DNG metadata/image info read. Perhaps some RAW formats as well.</li>
      <li>Other file formats, eg. WebP.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>API</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Support reading images incrementally, eg. page at a time for multi-page TIFFs, to save memory.</li>
      <li>Provide per-image image info in multi-image formats.</li>
	  <li>More control over writing.</li>
	  <li>Writing multiple images into a file.</li>
	  <li>Add support for more than 8 bits per channel.</li>
	  <li>Add support for reading and writing detailed XMP metadata fields.</li>
	  <li>Add request/hint params to ImageFactory, per Endre's suggestion.</li>
	  <li>Allow user to disable autoconvesion to sRGB/Grayscale.</li>
	  <li>More formats should subclass imagemetadata class to include format-specific info ie. GIF's transparency index.</li>
	  <li>Improve Javadoc and write more FAQs / examples.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Test suite</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Publish image library (possibly) and links to other libraries.</li>
      <li>Develop suite of unit tests that only depend on images in the public domain.</li>
      <li>Share test image suite with comments.</li>
  </ul>
