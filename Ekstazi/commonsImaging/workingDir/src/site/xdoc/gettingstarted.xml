<section name="Requirements">

<p>
  <ul>
      <li>Commons Imaging requires Java 1.7 or higher.</li>
      <li>The questions of porting to J2ME and Android have been raised, but not yet pursued.</li>
      <li>Commons Imaging has no dependencies.</li>
      <li>AWT is required. ImageIO is only required to compile and used optionally
        as a fallback when reading JPEG thumbnails.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

</section>

<section name="Getting Started">

<p>
  <ul>
      <li>Download the latest release from the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/imaging/download_imaging.cgi">download page</a>.</li>
      <li>Add the jar to your project's classpath.</li>
      <li>See our <a href="sampleusage.html">Sample Code</a> for examples.</li>
      <li>Refer to the project's <a href="apidocs/index.html">javadoc</a></li>

<section name="Building from the latest Source">
<p>
  There are two steps to building Commons Imaging from the latest source:
  <ul>
      <li>Check out the latest source from <a href="scm.html">git</a></li>
      <li>Build using <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven 2</a></li>
          <ul>
              <li>1. Install the latest version of Maven</li>
              <li>2. cd imaging-snapshot (if you are not already in the project directory)</li>
              <li>3. mvn -Prc package</li>
              <li>4. The build will be in the "target" folder.</li>
          </ul>
  </ul>
</p>
</section>

<section name="Logging">
<p>
  Commons Imaging uses the JDK java.util.logging (JUL) classes for logging. You can find out more about
  JUL in its <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/logging/overview.html">documentation</a>,
  or reading the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html">logging API documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>A more verbose output is available by enabling the log level <strong>FINE</strong></li>
    <li>Information that is useful for debug and troubleshooting is being logged with the <strong>FINEST</strong> log level</li>
    <li>Some exceptions that are not re-thrown are being logged with the <strong>SEVERE</strong> log level</li>
    <li>Commons Imaging loggers are created using the class name, so you should be able to filter the log output with the class or package names</li>
  </ul>
