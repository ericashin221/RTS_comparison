  <subsection name="2009-January Sanselan Incubator status report">
    <p>
      Sanselan has been in incubation since September 2007.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sanselan is a pure-java image library for reading and writing
      a variety of image formats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The community hasn't grown much in the past three months. There
      continues to be only one active committer. Participation level is low.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first official Apache release occurred on July 30th, 2008. A new
      release has just been prepared and is current being voted upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new release includes significant bug fixes, better documentation, better
      IPTC and XMP support (metadata) and improvements to the release structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barriers to graduation continue to be diversity, size of the community,
      and overall activity.

      The code base has been imported and the package names have been
      changed to org.apache.sanselan. Work continues on scrubbing the
      code and organizing it into maven.

      The autoexport from confluence to our site has been set up (see
      http://incubator.apache.org/sanselan/) so documenation
      can be added soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are looking for images (with no copyright restrictions) that
      can be used for unit testing. Existing (private) unit tests rely
      on copyrighted images that cannot be used.

      The project has kicked off with some basic infrastructure now in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mailing lists have been set up. The structure of the project has been
      discussed; plans are to use maven using Jackrabbit as a model.
    </p>
    <p>
      A site was created using Confluence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The svn repository has had the first code drop. Most of the code from the
      original base has been committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The JIRA project is set up and the initial code drop was posted for review.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial committers have been given access to the repository.
